        <h1>Top Three Favorite NBA Finals Memories</h1>

        <h2><u>2005 NBA Finals</u></h2>
        <p>This is the first NBA Finals I ever watched fully from game 1 to game 7. The Detroit Pistons
            faced off against the San Antonio Spurs and were hoping to repeat as NBA champions. However, 
            the Spurs stopped them in their tracks. I was a neutral fan, but my brother was an avid Spurs
             fan so it was fun watching the games with him as he cheered or screamed at the televion.

        <h2><u>2006 NBA Finals</u></h2>
        <p>When the Miami Heat went down 0-2 in the finals against the Dallas Mavericks, I thought it 
            was over for the Heat. The Mavs were favored to win against the Heat yet one man said no to 
            that: Dwyane Wade. He stepped it up and wound up carrying the Heat to four straight victories.
            This series had drama, surprises, and clutch performances; everything you want in a series.

    <div class="whatever">
        <h2><u>2008 NBA Finals</u></h2>
        <p>This Finals featured the Boston Celtics vs the Los Angeles Lakers. This season Kevin Garnett
            and Ray Allen joined Paul Pierce and the Celtics and became the first modern superteam. All 
            three hadn't had much success previously and to see them finally win a ring made me happy. 
            I still remember KG screaming emotionally "Anything is Possible!" at the top of his 
            lungs.</p>

    <div id="yes">
        <p>I've been watching the NBA for about a decade and a half and have so many positive memories 
            to choose from. Today I was feeling a bit nostalgic about the NBA so this list reflects 
            that. However, I still think these would be near my top memories even without my nostalgia 
            glasses on.
